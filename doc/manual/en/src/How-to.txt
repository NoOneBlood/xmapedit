On using HelpNDoc to edit the manual. By Seizhak.

1. Download HelpNDoc from their official website:
https://www.helpndoc.com/
2. Install the program.
3. Double-click on "XMapeditCHM".
4. Edit the contents or add new. Please let me know if you introduced new changes so I can review them and update accordingly.

On presentation and guidelines.

1. Every blue dot next to the table of contents means the content needs to be improved/reviewed.
2. Every yellow dot next to the table of contents means the content is still under development.
3. There's a chapter named "Table of contents" where the user can review each content and navigate directly to said content.
Once the content is fully improved/reviewed, you should add a direct link.

On adding content.

1. Please keep the original layout content. If you have any suggestion please tell what it is first; I can add modifications later on.

On translation.

1. Please keep the original layout content. When you make new discoveries or find out missing information, please tell that first so
I can keep the same content among different translations.
