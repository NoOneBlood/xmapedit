To build with Dev-C++, you will need to open and compile the projects in this order:
	1. libEngine.dev
	2. libEditor.dev
and then, to build the KenBuild editor and game:
	3. Game.dev
	4. Build.dev

With my system's configuration, the DirectX SDKs are stored in C:\sdks\directx\dx81,
so you will probably have to change that path in the project options of each project
to suit your system.
