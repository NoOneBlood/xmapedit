OS X libraries are automatically downloaded and compiled from source as part
of the Xcode build. See osx/build.sh for this process.

MSVC libraries were built using Visual Studio Community 2017. See msvc/build.ps1
for reference.

MinGW 32-bit binaries were compiled from vanilla Xiph.org libogg-1.1.4 and
libvorbis-1.2.3 sources using MinGW GCC 3.4.5.
